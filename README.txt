## Instructions:
Put these files anywhere you can access them with a web browser.  I personally use
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer

I use ngrok tunneling for mobile testing

## Notes
I included the extra credit using local storage to save attendance state.

FYI, I looked at the live events json API on hillaryclinton.com.  I notice that the events list includes the contact name and
phone number.  That seems ripe for abuse.  I could easily create "Donald Trips Virtual Evildoer" app which lists out the hillary
staff/organizers and call buttons to harass them.  This would be completely anonymous and doesn't first require an RSVP or any
identification.
